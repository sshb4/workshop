## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Still getting auth errors
**Solution**: Make sure you're using the exact same credentials that work locally

**Issue**: Database not found
**Solution**: Make sure your database file is included in the deployment (check .gitignore)

**Issue**: Different Vercel URL
**Solution**: Update NEXTAUTH_URL with your actual Vercel deployment URL

## üß™ Testing Locally vs Production

**Local URL**: http://localhost:3000
